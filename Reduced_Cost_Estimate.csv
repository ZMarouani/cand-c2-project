changes 
"- Reduce the amount of connections that the nat gateway will have to work with , which will reduce a little the disponibility of the application but won't effect it's perfomance for most users"
changes2
 - Reduced the size of database which can be fixed by keeping cached data in EC2 instances or can be fixed through the software part by compressing the old data
